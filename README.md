# Cancer-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
ICMR wants to analyze different types of cancers, such as breast cancer, renal cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer becoming a cause of worry in recent years. They would like to identify the probable cause of these cancers in terms of genes responsible for each cancer type. This would lead us to early identification of each type of cancer reducing the fatality rate.     Dataset Details:   The input dataset contains 802 samples for the corresponding 802 people who have been detected with different types of cancer. Each sample contains expression values of more than 20K genes. Samples have one of the types of tumors: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD, and PRAD.
